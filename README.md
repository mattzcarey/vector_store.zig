# vector_store.zig

> A simple vector store in Zig with cosine similarity search.

```bash
zig build
```

This will build the lib in `zig-out/lib/libvector_store..`. It will also run the main function in `src/main.zig`.

WIP FFI bindings to use the store in javascript land...

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
